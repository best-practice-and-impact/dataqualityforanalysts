# Data Quality for Analysts
## Introduction
Good quality data is data that is fit for purpose. 
This means that the data you are working with suits your needs. When analysing a dataset, you will be making decisions about what values you want to include or any cleaning you need to do. These decisions may be based on your knowledge of the analysis you would like to conduct, assumptions about the data or conversations you have had with the collector/supplier about it, and your experience with the type of data you are working with. During this process you are assessing how fit for your purpose – your analysis - the data is and what you need to do to mitigate any problems you have found. All these decisions are critical to the success of your analysis, and in ensuring as high a quality output as you can obtain based on the data you received. There is no problem   with having an analytical output where the quality has been prohibited by the data you have been using; no data is perfect. 
What is important is that you the analyst:
-	Understand how well the data fits the purposes you are using it for
-	Can articulate the effects of any strengths and limitations of the data on your analysis
-	Can communicate the above with the users of your outputs

Analytical outputs in government are often used to make big decisions which effect all members of society. It is therefore critical that we know how to assess and communicate quality across this ecosystem, from collection to analysis to decision making. This will support you the analyst in your work, as well as the policy makers and data collectors whose roles are influenced by the analysis you produce. Delivering not just the analysis, but the information you used to get there and the potential strengths and limitations of it, allows for essential context to be included in the decisions which are made with it. 

There are further benefits for you the analyst in conducting this work. Increasing communication about quality across this ecosystem increases the likelihood that quality issues are flagged, understood, and addressed where possible. Analysts may often feel that they “bear the brunt of poor-quality data”, developing complex work arounds to make the data fit their needs and disproportionately burdened by cleaning the data. Having the tools to understand what these quality issues are and communicate them both to data collectors and policy makers makes it much easier to solve these problems at source.  

This may feel like extra work in the short term, but there are so many work arounds that you are probably engaging with on a regular basis which could be avoided if there was a greater openness to communication about quality. These may look like:
- Cleaning, so much cleaning (this may also be referred to as data cleansing* reference see the footnote *)    
- Lots of back and forth with data collectors/suppliers to understand the provenance of data (what does column x mean?)
- *** Add to

You will have no doubt developed your own ways of assessing, mitigating and communicating quality, perhaps ad hoc over time or using examples of best practice you have found elsewhere. This guidance will streamline this process for you by compiling best practice, providing you with a one stop shop for how to assess and communicate quality as government analysts. That being said, knowing how much experience there exists across government, we are seeking to develop this guidance both for and with you. This is why we are hosting it on GitHub, to give you chance to input your ideas and experiences. Instructions for how to do this EXIST WHERE?  

## How to understand and measure data quality: the DQ dimensions
The definition of data quality as fitness for purpose might sound difficult to understand and assess in practice. This is why the DQ dimensions are a good way to describe your data and assess their quality level. A DQ dimension is ‘a recognised term […] to describe a feature of the data that can be measured […] to determine the quality of data’ ( [ DAMA White paper ] ( https://www.dama-uk.org/resources/Documents/DAMA%20UK%20DQ%20Dimensions%20White%20Paper2020.pdf ) ).
